# What are Widgets? #
> A widget is a device placed in a container of beer to manage the characteristics of the beer's head. 
The original widget was patented in Ireland by Guinness. The "floating widget" is found in cans of 
beer as a hollow plastic sphere, 3 cm in diameter (similar in appearance to a small table tennis ball) 
with a small hole in one side. The "rocket widget" is found in bottles, 7 cm in length with the small 
hole at the bottom.

# What are Widgets? #
> In computer programming, a widget (or control) is an element of a graphical user interface (GUI) 
that displays an information arrangement changeable by the user, such as a window or a text box. 
The defining characteristic of a widget is to provide a single interaction point for the direct 
manipulation of a given kind of data. In other words, widgets are basic visual building blocks which, 
combined in an application, hold all the data processed by the application and the available 
interactions on this data.
